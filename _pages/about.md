I'm a software developer with a focus on machine learning. I have a BEng in Mechanical Engineering, an MSc in Computer Science and I am a Chartered Engineer (CEng). Currently I am engaged in a Research Masters at University College Dublin with a focus on computer vision and machine learning and their application in the field of accessibility. I am a member of the [UCD Complex Software Lab](https://csl.ucd.ie/index.php/members/). Prior to my studies in Computer Science I worked at the automotive company Jaguar Land Rover UK for seven years as a systems engineer.

My areas of research include computer vision, machine learning and XR (mixed reality). Have a look at my [CV](/cv/) page for a little more computer science specific detail regarding languages, frameworks and concepts. My current published work can be found [here](/publications/). If you would like to discuss anything further, be sure to get in touch via email or connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertyoung6/).
