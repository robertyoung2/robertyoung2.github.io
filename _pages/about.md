I'm a software developer with a focus on machine learning. I have a BEng in Mechanical Engineering, an MSc in Computer Science and I am a Chartered Engineer (CEng). Currently I am engaged in a Research Masters at University College Dublin with a focus on Computer Vision, Machine Learning and how it can be applied to accessibility challenges. Prior to my studies in Computer Science I worked at the automotive company Jaguar Land Rover in the UK for seven years as a systems engineer.

My areas of research include computer vision, machine learning and XR (mixed reality). Have a look at my CV page for a little more computer science specific detail regarding languages, frameworks and concepts. My current published work can be found here.
