I'm a software developer with a focus on machine learning. In my previous life my experience was in the field of mechanical engineering. I have a BEng in Mechanical Engineering, an MSc in Computer Science and I am a Chartered Engineer (CEng). Currently I am engaged in a Research Masters at University College Dublin with a focus on Computer Vision, Machine Learning and how it can be applied to accessibility challenges. Prior to my studies in Computer Science I worked at the automotive company Jaguar Land Rover for seven years as a systems engineer.

My current areas of research and interest are computer vision, machine learning and and XR (mixed reality). Have a look at my CV page for a little more language and framework specific details, or connect with me on LinkedIn. You can find my current published work here.
